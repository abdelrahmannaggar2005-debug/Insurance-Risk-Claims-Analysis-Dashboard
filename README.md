# Insurance-Risk-Claims-Analysis-Dashboard

Project description.

I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing 37,542 insurance policies and $187.8M in claims. Key insights include total policies by car make/use/age/education, claim amounts by marital status, average claim frequency (0.5), and distributions across demographics (gender, kids driving, coverage zones). Interactive slicers and visuals enable risk profiling, claims trend identification, and data-driven decisions for underwriting and pricing optimization.
